# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:

To design an elegant, modern, and eco-conscious digital interface for “GreenSip Smoothies”, a brand specializing in organic, fresh, and healthy beverages. The goal is to reflect freshness, sustainability, and vitality through colors, layout, and interactive elements, ensuring a seamless experience on both web and mobile platforms.

## Algorithm:

I. Visual Design & Structure

Grouping: Organize related elements such as smoothie flavors, nutritional details, and offers together.

Hierarchy: Use large, bold titles for featured products and smaller text for descriptions.

Flow: Guide users from brand introduction (Hero Banner) → product catalog (best-sellers) → testimonials → final call-to-action (Order / Subscribe).

II. Platform Specifics
Web:

Hero Section: Display a vibrant image of fresh fruits and smoothies with a “Blend of Nature & Taste” tagline.

Navigation Bar: Include links like Home, Flavors, Health Benefits, Order Now, Contact. Highlight “Order Now” in green.

Content Display: Use a 3-column card grid for smoothies showing images, price, and “Add to Cart” button.

Mobile:

Use a hamburger menu (≡) for navigation.

Show smoothie cards in a scrollable vertical format.

Keep a floating “Order Now” button for quick access.

III. Interactivity & Branding

Color Palette: Shades of green, white, and orange to symbolize freshness and energy.

Hover Effects: Smooth scale-up animation for product cards.

Typography: Modern sans-serif font with natural tone headings.

Logo Placement: Place the GreenSip leaf logo on the top-left corner and use it as a watermark in background patterns.

## Output:

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="GreenTaste Smoothies Website   Mobile View" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7982ff5f-1d9c-43aa-b1b7-0247b38e7f4f" />
